## **Welcome to my gh.**

Bored dude who hates work. I'm a starter, not a finisher. I do things like keyboards and soccer and coding 'n stuff. Self taught and fluent in Python, still working with C#- stuff like sharpgl and stuff. Thunk of a lot of stuff in my time but of course *skill issue*- I can't actually do any of those things.
So maybe I'll actually start delivering once I put something in my head.

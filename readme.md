# Hi! I'm bat soup
I'm a younger developer- I have over 3 years of experience in developing in python and hardware manipulation.
I have a high-level knowledge of the discord API, HTML/CSS and using python to manipulate .json files.

I'm a frequent contributor to [monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com/); I've added multiple themes including Modern Ink and Trackday, and multiple others are waiting to be added now.

## What I like to do:
I really love custom mechanical keyboards (My own personal build is a DNA65 with GMK blue samurai and lubed purple pandas for anyone who wants to know), I love watching and playing soccer, I (obviously) do a bunch of coding and last but not least I snowboard- not very often as the season is short where I live but I do love it while it lasts.
